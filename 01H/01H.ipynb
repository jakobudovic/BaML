    "32 individuals take part in a study about nutritional behavior. One aspect of the study is comparing carni-vore diets to non-carnivore diets in terms of daily caloric intake. The research hypothesis states, that thedaily average caloric intake of individuals following a non-carnivore diet is lower, compared to individualsfollowing a carnivore diet. Out of 32 participants, 12 adhere to a non-carnivore diet, yielding an averagecaloric intake of ¯x1 = 1780 kcal. In contrast, the remaining 20 participants following a carnivore diet av-erage to ¯x2 = 1900 kcal per day. The respective estimated standard deviations result in s1 = 230, ands2 = 250. The daily caloric intake of an individual is assumed to be a normally distributed variable"
